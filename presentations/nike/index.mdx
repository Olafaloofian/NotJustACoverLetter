**If you have my resume on hand, you may look at it and think:**

<div className='textbox-uppercase' style={{ background: 'white' }}>
  "Wow, this guy isn't a programmer! He's a NOOB-grammer!"

  I don't blame you! Everyone wants that Senior with 20 years of experience, right?

<ScrollArea title='My Nike Story' body={<div><div>Love for Nike runs deep in the veins of my family. Rewind time three generations to the 1950's... My great-grandfather decided to start a legendary sports store called 'Kerr Sporting Goods' in Arizona. This business was one of the very first Nike distributors in the whole state! A lot of Kerr Sporting Goods' success can be attributed to this partnership - and in turn they helped put a lot of local sport teams into Nike gear. Although the company later ran into issues serious enough to force a shutdown, there isn't a person in my family who hasn't heard about the goodol' times of Kerr Sporting Goods and Nike. To this day, we all intentionally wear Nike clothing and shoes and show them off to each other. For a final note of perspective on how tied to Nike the Kerr family is: when my grandfather recently died he was buried in Nike socks.</div><div>From a young age, Nike's mission of encouraging people to get out and get physical has resonated with me. I've participated in many different sports and events while wearing many different Nike cleats and shoes. Simply put, I'm a fan to the very bone. I'd consider working with Nike a monumental honor. And in the end, having employees that truly care about the company is important, right?</div></div>} style={{background: 'white', color: 'black'}} />

#### I want to learn what goes into making a great company.

<div className='textbox-medium' style={{ background: 'white', color: 'black' }}>I'm interested in a lot more than just programming. As part of my developing career, one of my goals is to figure out the decisions that need to be made for a company to be successful. In my mind, there's no better place to get this experience than Nike.</div>

## What makes me different from other programmers?

<CircleAnimation />

<div className='textbox-medium' style={{ background: 'black', color: 'white' }}>
  The driving <span style={{ color: '#0083c3' }}>passion</span> in my life has always been <span style={{ color: '#0083c3' }}>creation.</span>
  <br/>
  After trying many different jobs, I became <span style={{ color: '#0083c3' }}>obsessed</span> with coding because of the pure channel it creates for me to transform my <span style={{ color: '#0083c3' }}>unique thoughts</span> into <span style={{ color: '#0083c3' }}>tangible outcomes.</span> I will use this <span style={{ color: '#0083c3' }}>creativity</span> to make <span style={{ color: '#0083c3' }}>Nike's</span> software <span style={{ color: '#0083c3' }}>stand out</span> in the sports apparel market!
