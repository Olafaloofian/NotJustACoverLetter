**If you have my resume on hand, you may look at it and think:**

<div className='textbox-uppercase' style={{ background: 'white' }}>
  "What on earth is an artist engineer?"
</div>

<br/>

<div className='textbox-medium' style={{ background: '#00619e', color: 'white' }}>
  I believe that every line of code I write is a work of art. In fact, I see my whole life as a series of artistic decisions!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As an engineer, I bring <span style={{ color: "#feb948"}}>characteristics</span> to the table that <span style={{ color: "#feb948"}}>reflect</span> my passion for design.

#### Carvana's culture resonates with me.

<div className='textbox-medium' style={{ background: 'white', color: '#79787d' }}>I've had the opportunity to tour Carvana HQ more than once, and every time I couldn't help but think to myself: "Working here would be sweet!".

## What makes me different from other programmers?

export default AltColorSlide

<CircleAnimation />

<div className='textbox-medium' style={{ background: 'black', color: 'white' }}>
  The driving <span style={{ color: '#1aaaec' }}>passion</span> in my life has always been <span style={{ color: '#1aaaec' }}>creation.</span>
  <br/>
  I love <span style={{ color: '#1aaaec' }}>programming</span> because of the pure channel it creates for me to transform my <span style={{ color: '#1aaaec' }}>unique thoughts</span> into <span style={{ color: '#1aaaec' }}>tangible outcomes.</span> I will use this <span style={{ color: '#1aaaec' }}>creativity</span> to make <span style={{ color: '#1aaaec' }}>Carvana's</span> software <span style={{ color: '#1aaaec' }}>stand out</span> in the market!
</div>

#### Three qualities that set me apart:

<BlockGraphic 
  text={{
    topText: 'When I approach a problem, I look at it from every angle until I discover a truly innovative and exciting solution. I\'m not one to settle for anything normal or boring.', 
    middleText: 'I am an extremely fast learner, able to pick up on new concepts and immediately start applying them.', 
    bottomText: 'I have an acute awareness of how the code I\'m writing affects Carvana\'s end users - and what that means to our finances.'
  }} 
  style={{ 
    topBlock: '#099CFB', 
    middleBlock: '#00619e', 
    bottomBlock: '#0085DB' 
  }}/>
