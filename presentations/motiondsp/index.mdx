<div style={{ borderRadius: '10px', background: 'white', padding: '30px 10px', textTransform: 'uppercase', fontWeight: '700', fontSize: '1.5em', margin: '30px auto 10px auto', width: '100%' }}>

<div style={{ borderRadius: '10px', background: '#1c6eda', color: 'white', fontSize: '1.2em', fontWeight: 'bold', padding: '80px 70px' }}>

  <br/>
  After trying many different jobs, I became <span style={{ color: '#1aaaec' }}>obsessed</span> with coding because of the pure channel it creates for me to transform my <span style={{ color: '#1aaaec' }}>unique thoughts</span> into <span style={{ color: '#1aaaec' }}>tangible outcomes.</span>
