## Reviewing job applications doesn't have to be a chore! This web app shows hiring managers different curated presentations that replace the traditional resume/coverletter application scheme.

#### Tips to a good presentation:

- Talk about projects
- Discuss unique experiences
- Use keywords to express your skills
- Tell a story about accomplishments
- Answer this question: What are you currently involved in and why is it applicable to this job?
